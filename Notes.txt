1. Specificity :- means priority of selectors 
Inline css > id > class > element
2. !important 
3. Order in which cssis declared , the last one have higher priority
4. Inheritance means some css propertues will apply on all the elements insiade the selector like color but some not like border


CSS is of 3 types:
1. INLINE
2.INTERNAL
3.EXTERNAL
1.INLINE CSS: An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.

To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1 style="color:blue;text-align:center;">This is a heading</h1>
<p style="color:red;">This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>


2. INTERNAL: 
An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.

The internal style is defined inside the <style> element, inside the head section.

Example
Internal styles are defined within the <style> element, inside the <head> section of an HTML page:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
body {
  background-color: linen;
}

h1 {
  color: maroon;
  margin-left: 40px;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>

3.EXTERNAL CSS:
With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!

Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element, inside the head section.

Example
External styles are defined within the <link> element, inside the <head> section of an HTML page:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css">
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>


***SELECTORS:
CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.
1. ELEMENT SELECTOR 
2. CLASS SELECTOR 
3. ID SELECTOR 
4. GROUP SELECTOR

1. element: 
-> The element selector selects HTML elements based on the element name.

2.ID selector

->The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.

The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!

To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.

Example
The CSS rule below will be applied to the HTML element with id="para1": 

#para1 {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

3. CLASS selecctor:
->The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.

To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name.

Example
In this example all HTML elements with class="center" will be red and center-aligned: 

.center {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

4.The CSS Universal Selector:
The universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements on the page.

Example
The CSS rule below will affect every HTML element on the page: 

* {
  text-align: center;
  color: blue;
}

5. The CSS Grouping Selector:
The grouping selector selects all the HTML elements with the same style definitions.

Look at the following CSS code (the h1, h2, and p elements have the same style definitions):

h1 {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

h2 {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

p {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

*****colors
they can be added by different types
1. names
2.rgb
3.hexadecimal
4. hsl(hue,saturation,lighting)


*****
span tag: it is an inline container used to used to group and style text or elements within a document without inherently 
altering their appearance.
--> in span tag the height and width property doesnot affect because it is an inline element 
-->They only take up as much width as necessary. Examples include <span>, <a>, <strong>, etc.

*Block elements: Take up the full width available and start on a new line. Examples include <div>, <p>, <h1>, etc.

Applying width and height to <span>:
To make width and height properties work on a <span>, you need to change its display behavior.
 You can use display: inline-block or display: block.
