FLEXBOX: IT IS A 1-D layout METHOD 
->full form flexible box
->parent container is called flex container
->the item which is present in the flex container is called flex item 
-> if we want to create any element as a flex we use display: flex
->by default the flex direction will be row 
->mainly it is used for responsive design of webpage for example if we increase or decrease the size the actual content 
will not be disturbed like if we minimize or maximize the screen

->flex: wrap
In CSS, flex-wrap is a property used in a flex container to control how flex items are wrapped when they do not fit within the container's width or height. By default, flex items are laid out in a single line (no wrapping), but you can modify this behavior with flex-wrap.

Here are the values it accepts:

nowrap (default): All flex items are laid out in 
a single line, and they will not wrap even if they overflow the container.
-- in simple words it make to come in the next line if the width or height is not available in the web page

***
The flex-flow property in CSS is a shorthand for setting both the flex-direction and flex-wrap properties in a flex container. These two properties together define how the flex container's children (flex items) are laid out, including the direction of the items and
 whether they wrap onto multiple lines.

 ***
 justify content:
 it place according to the main access
 if the flex direction is row then main axis is horizontal
 if the flex direction is column then main axis is vertical

 ***
 align items: it will align items irrespective to the axis 
 align content: removes the space when we use wrap
 ***
 flex-items
 1.flex-basis- it is used to define dimension
 2.flex-grow
 3.flex-shrink
 4.align -self

 summary:
 flex container:
 display
 flex direction
 flex wrap
 flex flow -> align items
 justify content -> align content

 flex items:
 order
 flex grow
 flex shrink
 flex basis
 align self


if flex direction is row the justify content will be horizontal
and align items will be column

if flex direction is column the justify content will be vertical 
and align items will be row
