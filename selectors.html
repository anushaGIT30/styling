    <h1>WELCOME TO C# TUTORIAL </h1>
    <p id="para1">C# tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of C#. Our C# tutorial is designed for beginners and
        professionals.

        C# is a programming language of .Net Framework.

        Our C# tutorial includes all topics of C# such as first example, control statements, objects and classes,
        inheritance, constructor, destructor, this, static, sealed, polymorphism, abstraction, abstract class,
        interface, namespace, encapsulation, properties, indexer, arrays, strings, regex,
        exception handling, multithreading, File IO, Collections etc.</p>
    <h2>What is C#</h2>
    <p id="para2">C# is pronounced as "C-Sharp". It is an object-oriented programming
        language provided by Microsoft that runs on .Net Framework.
    </p>
    <p class="class">By the help of C# programming language, we can develop different types of secured and robust
        applications:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Window applications</li>
        <li>Web applications</li>
        <li>Database applications etc.</li>
        <article>
            C# is approved as a standard by ECMA and ISO. C# is designed for CLI (Common Language Infrastructure). CLI
            is a specification that describes executable code and runtime environment.

            C# programming language is influenced by C++, Java, Eiffel, Modula-3, Pascal etc. languages.

    <h3>C# Features</h3>
    <p id="para3">C# is a simple language in the
        sense that it provides structured approach (to break the problem into parts), rich set of library functions,
        data types etc.</p>
    <p id="para4">C# programming is based upon the current trend and it is very powerful and simple for building
        scalable,
        interoperable and robust applications.</p>
    <p id="para5">C# is object oriented programming language. OOPs makes development and maintenance easier where as in
        Procedure-oriented programming language it is not easy to manage if code grows as project size grow.</p>
    <p class="class1"> In C# programming language, a simple "hello world" program can be written by multiple ways. Let's
        see
        the top 4 ways to create a simple C# example:

        Simple Example
        Using System
        Using public modifier
        Using namespace</p>
